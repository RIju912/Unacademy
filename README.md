- You'll need to create a view as designed below. The view is basically a TableView with cells, sections and headers. 
- Try to make it as customisable as possible with settings like aligment(center, left, right), dimensions, appearance, etc.  
- Your view should be able to adapt to the content of each cell item.
- To populate the TableView, you can download and parse the JSON data from https://gist.github.com/hemezh/660b426c758a20af38a40ac9e78e369d. 
- You can use third party libraries only for networking and parsing JSON.
- Try to use the best practices of iOS development.
- Use Swift 2.3 or 3.0 for your implementation.
